  "Re-frame dispatch enhanced for UI. On top of re-frame-dispatching args, it:
  * stops the default handling from happening, so links and forms don't get submitted.
  * it dispatches ui-interaction, currently used to hide old alerts
  * passes the target of the event (the form or link) as the last argument to the re-frame-dispatch."

; TODO: implement a way for many functions to be called when ui-interaction is dispatched. Right now we don't need  this as we have only one event handler in alerts.cljs.
