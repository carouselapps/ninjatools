Hello {{name}},

We just received a request to reset your password for Ninja Tools. If you requested it, go to

{{set-password-url}}

and set a new password.

If it wasn't you, it's probably nothing to worry about, but you can change your password if you want. We recommend using
long random passwords that are impossible to guess, generated by one of the many tools for this purpose.
